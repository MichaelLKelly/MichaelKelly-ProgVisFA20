Here's the repo that will contain work for the Fall 2020 Prohgramming Interactive Visualizations course at Pratt Institute. It has brought me back to GitHub after some time away. 
While ultimately I recognize this as a good thing, the re-acclimation to GitHub, Terminal and other interactions that I first worked with a year ago is a bit daunting â€” like once more trying to speak a language that I only 'learned' previously for a two-week vacation.
All that said, I look forward to the work this will contain.
