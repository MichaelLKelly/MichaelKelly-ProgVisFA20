This week’s viz is a further investigation into the Beatles evaluation data that was part of last week’s project. Now, all evaluated songs for one ranker are listed, regardless of album, and each is represented by a ‘mop’ path, which is then shaded to reflect the individual’s ranking of the song using scaleLinear. The dataset is provided through a csv, and the height of the svg for the viz is determined by the length of the dataset — meaning that additions to the csv will create a taller svg to accommodate them.
