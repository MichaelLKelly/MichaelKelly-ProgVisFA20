Here’s my scatterplot code and screenshot, including some attempts at styling, and the start of horizontal grid lines. It took some figuring, and I think there are still things I don’t quite get about dataset and d, but it works well. 

I also worked some with the SVGShapes file, which is where I first started trying the grid, and discovered that I apparently cannot create both vertical and horizontal grid lines — so I am sure there is some way different from this process of making that happen. And I look forward to learning it.
