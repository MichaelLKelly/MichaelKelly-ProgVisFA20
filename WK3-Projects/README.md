The data for this week is pulled from a project that my friends decided to undertake a few weeks back and is still in progress. They (Steven and Lisa) have chosen to listen to all of The Beatles’ albums in order and decide if they actually like The Beatles as much as everyone else seems to. They are listening to each album, choosing if they like a song at all and then ranking the ones they like from 1 to 6. I wanted to compare their separate responses, but that was a little beyond my scope at the moment, so I focused on Steven, whose responses were a bit more varied than Lisa’s. I took the individual source data, cleaned things up a little and calculated some averages and totals.

There were a couple of visualizations I wanted to try, and some things I wanted to explore (like changing a circle radius based on variable data — making a kind of bubble chart) so I went ahead and created them both and then placed them in a single document. Trying to feed the css in created a bit too much of a headache for now, so will have to explore that in the future.
