Week 7 Homework

Interactive Beatles Rankings



For this color-themed project, I chose to look at the context of color in two senses, juxtaposing text from Ruben Pater’s “Colour and Culture” section of The Politics of Design with color studies inspired by Albers. Together they make a statement about how a color might be viewed differently in different environments.

I used separate csvs for each color group (all of which are in the folder with the code) to provide name and coloring of the lines (which were then turned into segments via styling for maximum contrast). After trying a few options for the background, I used a sequential scale with 21 divisions to create a gradient effect that remains segmented to signify a diversity of cultures. (It was also a convenient means by which to try out different numbers for maximum effect.)

The text (or most of it) is of course by Pater, and the color designations are standard, but sourced specifically from htmlcolorcodes.com.

Below are representative screenshots of the entire piece, which scrolls a fair amount. (Internal page links are used to jump from color group to color group.)
