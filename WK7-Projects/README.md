Week 7 Homework

Interactive Beatles Rankings 

For this week's interactive visualization, I chose to rework some earlier charts to take advantage of interactivity. (I also took this opportunity to update the file by having it access the data in a CSV.) Previously I had created a ranking of Beatles albums based on my friend's reviews, with line height showing average ranking of songs for the album and circle size showing percentage of songs on the album that were 'liked' to begin with. Introducing interactivity allowed me to make the circle-percentage a clickable animation, to reveal a tooltip with the precise percentage of songs, and to introduce a second chart on demand.

Below are representative screenshots of the interaction's progression.

1. The default view shows the averages, with ghosted circles showing the entirety of the album.

2. A single click on the ghosted circle for an album casues an animation to a circle size that represents the percentage of songs that were liked, and revelas a tooltip stating the actual percentage.
In addition, a second chart of the album's individual song rankings is displayed. This data is supplied by a separate CSV.

3. Single clicks on other albums reveal tooltips for each. (It was also the intention that the second chart woudl update for each album, but I haven't quite figured out that code.)

4. As per the directions, doubleclicking the circle then resets the interaction.
